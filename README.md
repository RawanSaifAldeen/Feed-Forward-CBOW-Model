# Feed-Forward-CBOW-Model
Predicting Verbs Using Feed-forward CBOW Model, a research project done at the end of the "Applied Data Mining" module (MSc. Data Science @ Lancaster University)

Abstract:
In this work, a simple language model was
built using a two-layer feed-forward CBOW architecture
then examined for its abilities of
predicting verbs in sentences extracted from
BBC news articles from 5 categories: business,
entertainment, politics, sport and technology,
The size of the context window was
investegated for its effect on the model performance
in addition to word lemmatization. It
was found that a context window of 6, 7 or
8 words achieved the best models in all categories
both with and without lemmatization
resulting in predicting the verbs in the top 10
≈ 75%-80% and in the top 5 ≈ 67%-77%.
While lemmatization was found to slightly reduce
the model generalization abilities which
was unexpected.
